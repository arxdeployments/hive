"""performance indexes: users roster ordering and the attachment foreign key

Revision ID: b7e21c4a9d33

Two indexes, both measured rather than guessed.

users (org_id, display_name) — GET /api/users/contacts now takes a LIMIT, and
without a matching index a capped query is still a top-N heapsort over the whole
tenant: 702 buffers touched to return 200 rows against a seeded 25,000-user org.
The column order matches the query exactly (equality on org_id, then the ORDER BY
on display_name), which is what lets Postgres walk the index and stop at the cap
instead of sorting the tenant.

message_attachments (message_id) — an unindexed foreign key on the hottest join
in the product. Every message page joins attachments back to messages, and every
attachment lookup was a sequential scan of the whole table.

BOTH ARE BUILT CONCURRENTLY, and for carinrowena that is not optional. It takes
UPDATEs on three hot paths — login and token refresh both stamp last_seen_at
(app/api/auth.py), and so does every WebSocket liveness tick
(app/realtime/hub.py). A plain CREATE INDEX takes a SHARE lock, which conflicts
with the ROW EXCLUSIVE those writes hold, so building it non-concurrently would
block every login, every refresh and every heartbeat in the fleet for the length
of a full table scan.

CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction, hence the autocommit block, which
costs this migration its atomicity — so each statement is preceded by a DROP IF
EXISTS. A failed concurrent build leaves an INVALID index behind, and a plain
CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS would mistake that for a finished one and report success
while the index enforced and accelerated nothing. Same pattern, and the same
reasoning, as c5d81e37a204.
