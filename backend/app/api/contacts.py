"""Contacts roster — GET /api/users/contacts.

Wire contract preserved from RxHivexx (docs/reference/api-uploads-calls-misc.md):
bare array response with the `department_name` key (the /api/search contacts
bucket calls the same concept `department`). Fixes vs the Mongo build: the
search input is escaped + parameterized (was raw $regex — injection/ReDoS),
and departments are batch-joined instead of one lookup per user.

    The cap is the point. This used to return the entire org roster on every
    contact-picker open: measured against a seeded 25,000-user tenant, one call
    was 24,999 rows and 5.5 MB, took ~430ms, and spent ~130ms of that inside a
    single Redis pipeline issuing 24,999 EXISTS — all on the event loop, so it
    stalled every other request the worker was serving. Nothing consumed more
    than a screenful of it.

    Every picker in the app already narrows with `search`, which is what makes a
    cap safe: the roster is reachable, it is just no longer shipped whole. The
