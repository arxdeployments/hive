"""WebSocket hub: per-worker connection registry + Redis pub/sub delivery.

Any worker can serve any user: events are published to user:{id} channels
(app.realtime.redis_bus) and each worker's single pub/sub reader forwards to
the sockets it holds locally. Presence lives in Redis, so worker count is
invisible to clients — the single-node ceiling of the Mongo build is gone.

Client-facing protocol preserved from RxHivexx (docs/reference/ws-protocol.md):
inbound  ping / message / typing_start / typing_stop / read_receipt / call:*
outbound connected / pong / error / message_ack / new_message / message_status /
         messages_read / typing / presence / conversation + call events.
