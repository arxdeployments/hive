Fan-out model: every realtime event is published to the per-user channel

therefore scoped at publish time — a socket can never receive an event for a

    THE TIMEOUTS ARE THE POINT. redis-py defaults socket_timeout and
    socket_connect_timeout to None, so a command against a broker that has
    stopped answering — a partition, a dropped NAT mapping, a wedged broker,
    anything that is not a clean refusal — waits forever. Measured against a
    server that completes the TCP handshake and then never replies, `incr` was
    still hanging when the harness gave up.

    That is what made the whole fail-open design in degrade_on_outage
    conditional: it can only degrade on an EXCEPTION, and silence raises
    nothing. So the outage story held for a broker that closes connections
    (restart, refusal) and inverted for one that just stops talking — every
    request touching Redis hung instead of continuing, holding its DB session
    from a pool of 10 the whole time, until the pool was gone and endpoints that
    never touch Redis stopped answering too. Login, refresh, presence, message
    fan-out and the call deadlines all sit on this client.

    With a deadline, silence becomes redis.exceptions.TimeoutError — a RedisError,
    which degrade_on_outage catches — and best-effort work is skipped as designed.
