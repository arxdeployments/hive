"""Calling on LiveKit: the backend mints scoped room tokens and tracks
lifecycle/history; media never touches this process (SFU's job).

Replaces the hand-rolled 6-person WebRTC mesh + public TURN + blind signaling
relay. Client-facing WS events keep the RxHivexx names (call:incoming,
call:accepted, …) so the salvaged UI flow survives; SDP/ICE relay events are
gone — the LiveKit client SDK talks to the SFU directly.

Cross-worker state (who is in which call) lives in Redis.

## Reachability and survivability

Three properties this module is responsible for, because every client depends on
them and none of them can be fixed client-side:

**A ring is not gated on a live socket.** A callee whose WebSocket happens to be
absent at the instant of dialling — an iOS app that just backgrounded, a laptop
mid-Wi-Fi-handover, a tab whose 15-minute access cookie just lapsed — used to be
refused immediately with `call:unavailable`, so the phone never rang at all. The
call now rings for its whole window regardless, a Web Push is dispatched to wake a
sleeping web client, and `resume_calls_for` re-delivers `call:incoming` the
moment that user's socket reappears. "Offline" is reported as a *hint* on
`call:ringing_started`, never as a refusal.

**A dropped link is a pause, not a hang-up.** `handle_user_link_down` no longer
ends the call; it opens a grace window, tells the peers so they can show
"Connecting…", and only resolves the call if the user is still missing when the
window closes. This is what makes a call survive a lift-doors dead spot — and it
is also what stops the routine 15-minute token-expiry reconnect from killing every
call longer than the remaining cookie lifetime.

**Timers are durable and worker-agnostic.** Ring timeouts and grace windows are
Redis deadlines swept by any worker (`app.services.call_deadlines`), not asyncio
tasks in a per-process dict. See that module for what the old scheme lost.

    id the SFU enforced that for us, by evicting the earlier connection as a
    duplicate — badly (silently, and it killed whichever client happened to connect
    first), but it did enforce it. Per-device identities removed that side effect,
    and with it the guarantee: a user signed in on two clients could put two
    microphones and two speakers into one call.

    That does not sound like a duplicate participant to the person on the other end.
    It sounds like **echo, and their own voice coming back several times with a
    delay** — one copy per extra leg, each on its own jitter path. If the two clients
    are in the same room (or on the same machine, sharing a microphone) it becomes a
    feedback loop that no amount of echo cancellation can fix, because each device's
    AEC only knows about its own output, never the other's.

    So the rule is now enforced here, deliberately and visibly: newest join wins,
    older legs are removed by the server and logged. Best-effort — a failure to
    reach the SFU must not stop a legitimate join, since the common case is a first
    join with nothing to evict.

    """Pull people into a group call that is already running.

    The missing half of "group calling". `_join` admits only users who already hold a
    `CallParticipant` row, and those rows are created once, from the conversation's
    membership, at the moment the call starts. So before this existed a group call was
    a closed set decided at second zero: anyone who was not in the conversation could
    not be added, and the "Add people" buttons on the call screens had nothing to call
    and were wired to nothing.

    Rules, and why:

      * **Only someone already in the call may invite.** Otherwise a call becomes a way
        to make anyone's phone ring by knowing a call id.
      * **Group calls only.** Adding a third party to a 1:1 would silently change what
        both people agreed to be in; promoting a direct call to a group is a different
        feature with its own consent question.
      * **Same org**, checked per invitee against the inviter, exactly as
        `initiate_direct_call` does — a call must not become a second reachability
        channel that skips tenant isolation.
      * **Ringing, not conscription.** An invitee gets `call:incoming` and chooses. They
        are added to the roster as an invited-but-not-joined participant, which is the
        same state a conversation member starts in, so `_join` then accepts them
        through the ordinary path.

    Returns a per-invitee outcome so the caller's UI can say which ones it could not
    reach, rather than reporting a bare success for a partial result.
