"""Wire-format serialization of conversations and messages.

Shapes mirror the RxHivexx contract the salvaged frontend expects
(docs/reference/api-conversations-messages.md): serialized docs use `_id`
string keys, ISO-Z datetimes, participants carry display data + per-user
unread counts, messages carry sender enrichment + reply preview.

Unread counts and read receipts are DERIVED from conversation_participants.
last_read_at instead of stored counters — one source of truth, no drift.

    user's last_read_at, not sent by them, not deleted-for-them, not system.

    Counted per conversation through a LATERAL, and the cursor is a COALESCE
    rather than an OR. BOTH halves are load-bearing and neither works alone —
    measured on a seeded 2.1M-message tenant, one sidebar page of 30 conversations:

        hash join + OR (as it was)   96-102ms   58,059 buffers
        LATERAL, OR kept                199ms   13,744   <- worse
        hash join + COALESCE          no change  33,746   <- still a Join Filter
        LATERAL + COALESCE (this)       1.1ms      512

    last_read_at arrives from the joined participant row, so with a hash join the
    cursor can only be applied AFTER the join, as a Join Filter — which is why this
    read the whole messages table and threw away 99.8% of it to count 1,747 rows.
    The LATERAL makes last_read_at a per-conversation constant. Separately,
    (last_read_at IS NULL OR created_at > last_read_at) is not indexable at all:
    the IS NULL disjunct means created_at cannot bound the scan, so even inside the
    LATERAL Postgres still read every message in the conversation. COALESCE to
    -infinity is the same predicate with one branch, so it becomes an index
    condition on ix_messages_conversation_created and the scan starts at the cursor.

    The old cost tracked the tenant's TOTAL history: adding a million messages to
    conversations this user is not a member of took it from 33,746 buffers to
    58,059, while this version went from 510 to 512.

    sender_id != user_id is kept EXACTLY as it was, NOT made NULL-safe. System
    messages have a NULL sender, so `NULL != user_id` is NULL rather than true and
    they are excluded — which is what "not system" above means. IS DISTINCT FROM
    would silently start counting every system message as unread.

    selectinload followed up for its sender and its attachments: a measured 152
    queries for a 50-row page of replies, and roughly 600 for a 200-row /starred.

    The second problem is worse than the first. That per-row read passed
    populate_existing=True with only sender/attachments in its options, so whenever
    the target was ALSO a member of the page it refreshed that member and EXPIRED
    the reactions collection MESSAGE_LOAD_OPTIONS had eagerly loaded for it. Then
    the loop reached that row, touched msg.reactions, and lazy-loaded — which under
    asyncio is MissingGreenlet, a 500. /messages escaped it because a reply target
    is always older and that endpoint reverses to oldest-first, so the clobbered row
    had already been serialized. /starred and /pinned order newest-first and do not
    reverse, so they reached it afterwards and failed. Starring or pinning a message

    arrived with the full load options, and refreshing it IS the bug. Only genuinely
    absent targets are queried, and those keep populate_existing, because
    list_messages resolves `before`/`around` anchors with db.get(), which leaves a
    bare Message in the identity map that would otherwise satisfy this query with no

    `is_starred` is the REQUESTING user's star, so it needs `for_user`; with no
    user context it is False. `client_msg_id` is likewise scoped to `for_user` —
    a caller that omits it gets a document safe to fan out to anyone, which is
    what the send path wants. List endpoints pass pre-computed `starred_ids` /
    `pinned_ids` sets so a page costs two queries instead of two per message, and
    `reply_targets` for the same reason — see that function for why passing it also
    keeps this off a 500.
