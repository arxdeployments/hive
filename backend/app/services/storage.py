# against 33 KB. Photographic content gains nothing perceptually from full chroma,
# so that is a doubling for nothing on exactly the largest files. Text-heavy

# admits: one thumbnail grows RSS by about 290 MB, eight concurrently peaked at
# 3.0 GB. anyio's default limiter allows 40, and API_WORKERS is 2, so the box
