"""GET /api/admin/organizations/{org_id}/users — the cross-org member picker's roster.

This endpoint had no tests. It is also the only roster endpoint in the API with no
ceiling: org_admin.list_users and admin's own user list both paginate at
`limit <= 100`, and api/contacts.list_contacts caps at 500 after measuring the
unbounded version at 24,999 rows and 5.5 MB on a 25,000-user tenant. This one
still returns every active member of an organization, and its one caller
(pages/admin/CrossOrgGroups.jsx) is a member picker.

What is fixed here is the waste that needed no contract change: it fetched rows it
then discarded, and materialized every column of the User entity — password_hash
included — to serialize five fields.
