"""What an org admin may do to accounts.

One rule, and it needs closing in two directions to mean anything:

  1. An admin creates MEMBERS, never admins. POST /users is the obvious route;
     PUT /users/{id} with role=admin is the same grant reached through a member
     who already exists.
  2. An admin cannot take over an admin that already exists. Blocking creation
     while leaving seizure open would protect nothing — reset-password returns
     the new password in its own response body, so one call against a peer hands
     the actor a working login for an account they do not own.

Department scoping used to live here too, and is gone with the access-control
feature: an org admin manages their whole organisation again. What is left is
the role boundary, which never depended on departments.
