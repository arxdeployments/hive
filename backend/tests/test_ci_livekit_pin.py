"""CI's SFU is a pinned, checksum-verified LiveKit, not whatever is newest.

The calling specs run against a real LiveKit, installed in the e2e job. It came
from get.livekit.io, which installs the latest release at run time, so on
2026-10-07 the SFU under those specs moved from 1.13.7 to 1.13.8 with no commit
behind it. 1.13.8 cuts a 1:1 callee's data channels when the server deletes the
room at call end, calling.spec's console check caught it, and the build went red
on a branch that touched no call code (batch 73). Pinned, with the archive's
checksum checked, an upgrade is a commit that runs the calling specs against the
new SFU before anyone has to trust it.
