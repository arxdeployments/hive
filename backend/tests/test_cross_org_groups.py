# otherwise both see the last free slot. Two tests that genuinely proved it were
# written and both were thrown away:
#
#   1. Two real requests through asyncio.gather. Passed with the lock REMOVED —
#      the event loop ran the first request to completion before the second began,
#      so it asserted the invariant and detected nothing.
#   2. The same, forced to interleave with a barrier, and then a single-request
#      version probing for the lock with SELECT ... FOR UPDATE NOWAIT from a second
#      session. Both detected the race correctly, and both deterministically broke
#      test_concurrent_identical_sends_store_one_message in the same run — three
#      times out of three.
#
# That failure is NOT caused by the lock. Verified by reverting api/cross_org.py
# and api/groups.py to HEAD and re-running: it still fails, so anything scheduled
# before that test exposes it. One of its four concurrent identical sends comes
# back as an IntegrityError rather than a replay, which means the loser's
# post-rollback lookup in services/messaging.py found no winner and re-raised —
# a real latent race in the idempotency path, reported separately.
#
# A test that reds an unrelated test is worse than no test, and papering over it
# here would hide the messaging bug. The lock stays; the coverage waits for that
# race to be fixed.
