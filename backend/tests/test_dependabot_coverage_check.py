"""Tests for scripts/check_dependabot_coverage.py.

The config it guards exists because ci.yml spent months telling readers
"(Dependabot handles pinned SHAs and rewrites the comment)" while no Dependabot
config existed — every pinned action three major versions behind, with a comment
reassuring anyone who looked.

A coverage check is only worth having if it cannot quietly pass, and this one
already failed that once: keying terraform on "main.tf" detected nothing, because
infra/terraform holds compute.tf and seven others. It passed while blind to the
whole ecosystem. These cover detection per ecosystem rather than the aggregate.
