"""Tests for scripts/check_dependency_groups.py.

The check exists because grouping pip updates by update type alone ignored which
pins constrain each other, and Dependabot then proposed manifests pip refuses to
resolve. Four of the twenty-one PRs open on 2026-09-03 failed at `pip install` for
that reason, none of them a broken dependency:

  #71  starlette past fastapi's starlette<0.47.0
  #67  pywebpush 2.5.0 needing cryptography>=47.0.0 against a pinned 44.0.0
  #70  pytest 9.1.1 against pytest-asyncio 0.25.3's pytest<9
  #68  pytest-asyncio 1.4.0 needing pytest>=8.4 against a pinned 8.3.4

A guard against that is only worth having if it cannot quietly pass, and the ways
this one could are specific: an update-types restriction on a cluster lets a major
escape into its own PR, a member left out of the patterns or removed by
exclude-patterns splits off, an earlier overlapping group takes one member, and
three separate things make the graph itself wrong rather than the grouping — a pin
whose metadata is not installed, a pin installed at a version other than the one
pinned, and a pin whose extras are dropped so the extra's requirements evaluate
False without raising. Each is asserted to fail here.
