"""Postgres and Redis are pinned in four places. One of them is watched.

    engine      ci.yml      compose.yml   compose.prod.yml   terraform
    postgres    16-alpine   16-alpine     -- (managed RDS)   engine_version "16"
    redis       7-alpine    7-alpine      7-alpine           --

All four agree today. Nothing makes them.

Dependabot covers infra/ under the docker-compose ecosystem and moves those
files on its own. It does not cover the service images in ci.yml — the
github-actions ecosystem updates `uses:` references and nothing else — and its
terraform ecosystem tracks provider and module versions, not an `engine_version`
string on a resource. So a routine bump moves exactly one of the four.

Two such PRs are open right now: #57 takes compose from postgres:16-alpine to
18-alpine, and #58 takes redis from 7-alpine to 8-alpine. Merging #57 leaves the
development stack on Postgres 18, CI validating every migration and query
against 16, and production on an RDS instance created at 16. Two majors between
what developers run and what CI proves, in the direction where CI is the one
that is wrong — it would go green on SQL that production cannot run.

This does not decide which version is right. It asserts only that the four
declarations say the same thing, so moving one of them is a failure that names
the other three rather than a silent divergence discovered later.
