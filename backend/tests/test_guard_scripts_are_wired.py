"""A guard nothing runs is not a guard.

scripts/check_dependency_groups.py was written in batch 48 against a measured
failure — four of the twenty-one Dependabot PRs open on 2026-09-03 could not be
resolved by pip, because pins that constrain each other were split across
separate update groups. The script reads the real dependabot.yml and
requirements.txt and fails when a coupled cluster is split again.

ci.yml never invoked it. Its only two mentions anywhere under .github were
prose, in comments inside dependabot.yml.

The reason that survived review is the interesting part. The script has a test,
tests/test_dependency_groups_check.py, and that test is thorough — it builds
synthetic manifests and asserts the script rejects each way a group can go
wrong. So the suite was green, the guard was covered, and the invariant it
exists for was still unchecked against this repository. Coverage of the checker
is not coverage of the thing checked.

This asserts the wiring itself, so the next guard cannot be born dead.

      * `re.split` on `&&` and `;` read a separator inside a quoted string as a
        real one, so `echo 'note; python scripts/check_x.py'` looked wired.
      * shlex's commenters cut at a `#` anywhere, so
        `python scripts/check_x.py#note` looked wired, where a shell reads one
        word naming a path that does not exist.

    double quote, backslash — and nothing else, because nothing else changes
    where a word begins or whether a `#` opens a comment.

    No expansion is attempted: `$VAR`, globs and substitutions stay literal.
