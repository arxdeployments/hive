"""An index built on a table that already has rows must not block writes.

Three migrations say this, at length. b7e21c4a9d33 calls it not optional:

    A plain CREATE INDEX takes SHARE for the length of a full heap scan, which
    conflicts with the ROW EXCLUSIVE that INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE take: it blocks
    writes and leaves reads alone.

and a4f81c6b2e07 says what that costs in this deployment specifically:

    Production boots with `alembic upgrade head && python -m app.seed &&
    uvicorn ...` (infra/docker-compose.prod.yml), so blocking here does not
    merely queue writes — the API never finishes starting.

Nothing enforced it. Two migrations built indexes on tables that already
existed, plainly: 4471a6d661d3 on `messages`, a row per message sent, and
c3f1a7b92d04 on `conversation_participants`. The first is fixed — it creates an
index and nothing else, so leaving the transaction costs it no atomicity. The
second is exempt below, for a stated reason and only for the index it names.

An index on a table the same migration creates is a different case and is
allowed: the table is empty, nothing else can hold a lock on it, and
CONCURRENTLY cannot run in the transaction that created it anyway.

Everything here reads statements per function and in order. A file-wide search
cannot answer any of these questions honestly: an autocommit block in
downgrade() would vouch for a bare CONCURRENTLY in upgrade(), and a drop in
downgrade() would vouch for a build in upgrade() that never clears its own
failed attempt.
