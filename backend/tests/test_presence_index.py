"""The online index: counting who is online without reconstructing the answer.

`presence:{user_id}` stays the authority on whether ONE person is online. These
sorted sets exist only to answer HOW MANY, which previously meant either walking
the whole Redis keyspace (the superadmin tile) or reading a tenant's entire user
list out of Postgres and issuing one EXISTS per row (the org tile).

The index is advisory by design, and the last test here is the one that matters
most: every write into it is best-effort, so a drifted or unavailable index can
put a wrong number on an admin tile but can never take a socket down or turn a
user's dot the wrong colour.
