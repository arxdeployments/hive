"""Presence during a Redis outage, against the promise the module already makes.

services/presence.py states the rule in get_statuses' own docstring — "an outage
must cost a green dot, not the whole request" — and keeps it in five places:
_index_add, _index_remove, _count, is_online and get_statuses all run their Redis
work inside degrade_on_outage.

Three functions did not, and two of those are reached on every connection:

  * refresh() is the ping branch of the websocket loop (realtime/hub.py). It sits
    OUTSIDE the try/except that wraps _handle_inbound, and the enclosing try
    catches only WebSocketDisconnect — so a RedisError there leaves the endpoint
    entirely. A blip drops every connected socket on its next ping, within the
    60s heartbeat, all at once.
  * mark_offline() runs in that loop's `finally`. Raising from a finally masks
    whatever actually ended the connection and skips the rest of the teardown —
    including handle_user_link_down, which is the grace window that keeps a call
    alive across a reconnect. hub.py's own comment lists that skip as one of the
    consequences it moved the `try` earlier to prevent.
  * mark_online() raises into a guarded region and is torn down correctly, so it
    is left alone; see the note on it below.

# redis-py's ConnectionError, not the builtin. They are different exceptions:
# redis.exceptions.ConnectionError subclasses RedisError and NOT OSError, while
# the builtin subclasses OSError. degrade_on_outage catches (RedisError, OSError),
# so a double raising the builtin is handled through the OSError arm and never
# exercises the arm a real redis-py failure takes — a test that passes for a
# reason other than the one it names. Narrowing that guard to OSError alone would
# break every outage path in production while leaving these green.
