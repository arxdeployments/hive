"""Deactivating a conversation must stop the signals as well as the content.

`is_active = False` is the only lever a superadmin has to cut a tenant off from a
cross-org group: archiving or deleting one leaves every ConversationParticipant row
in place (cross_org.py delete_group sets deleted_at and is_active and nothing
else), so the flag IS the revocation. Every content path enforces it —
_require_send_access, _member_attachment, the message lists, search, the media
drawer, the contact list.

Three signal paths did not, and they run on membership alone:
  * typing indicators (hub._is_participant),
  * presence fan-out (hub._conversation_partner_ids),
  * read receipts (messaging.mark_read).

So a tenant cut off from a group kept broadcasting into it and kept receiving its
members' online status, indefinitely, while their messages and media 404'd.
