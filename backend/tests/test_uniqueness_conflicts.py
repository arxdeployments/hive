"""Concurrent creates and renames must refuse with 400, not 500.

Every create and rename in the two admin surfaces checks for a clash and then
writes. That check is check-then-act: two requests can both pass it, and the
database constraint is what actually enforces uniqueness — so the loser of the
race has to become the same 400 a sequential duplicate gets.

Three of nine sites did that. api/admin.py guarded its creates and not its
renames; api/org_admin.py guarded nothing. An org admin creating a user whose
email was taken concurrently got a 500 where a superadmin doing the identical
thing got a clean 400.

WHAT THESE TESTS DO AND DO NOT PROVE

A genuine two-request race is not forced here. The pre-check answers first in any
sequential test, so driving one over HTTP exercises the pre-check and not the
guard — which is how a test like that passes while saying it covers the race.
Instead: the helper is tested directly against a real IntegrityError, the
constraints are proven to fire, and the nine call sites are pinned by a wiring
assertion. Said plainly rather than dressed up.
